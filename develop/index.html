                    <p>
                        Hello, dear reader! My name is Nick, and I'm a beginner coder attending the coding bootcamp online through Columbia University. I originally attended Ithaca College for music composition, and afterwards, ended up as a dog trainer.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        After working in that field for five years, though, I decided it was time for a change in my life. So, after some gentle nudging, I decided to enroll in the coding bootcamp through Columbia University. So far, the program has been a lot of fun, albeit very challenging at times.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In addition to being a coding student and a dog trainer, I'm also a writer of fantasy and science fiction, as well as a cosplay/LARPer. I have several pets, including a handful of rats, two rabbits, a snake, and many, many fish.
                    </p>
